# Code Commenting Best Practices

Good comments are crucial for code maintainability. They should explain the "why," not the "what."

- Explain complex logic: If a piece of code is particularly intricate, a comment can help others understand it.
- Provide context: Explain why the code is necessary.
- Add warnings: If a piece of code is fragile or has known issues, a comment can warn other developers.
