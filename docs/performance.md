# Performance Optimization

- Avoid premature optimization: Profile your code to find bottlenecks before you start optimizing.
- Use efficient algorithms: The choice of algorithm can have a huge impact on performance.
- Cache results: If a function is expensive to compute, cache its results to avoid re-computing them.
